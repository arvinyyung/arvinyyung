			Hello everyone! I'm a Masters student in <a target="_newtab" href="https://biotech.brown.edu/about/">Biotechnology</a> at Brown University. I have recentely joined the <a target="_newtab" href="https://sites.brown.edu/center-for-spine-tumor-chordoma-research/">Center for Spine Tumor & Chordoma Research Lab</a> where I am building on research relating to hydrogels as a drug delivery mechanism. 
				Before coming to Brown, I earned B.Scs. in Microbioloy and Psychology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. At UMass, I was an undergraduate reserach assistant in the <a target="_newtab" href="https://websites.umass.edu/wilmore/">Webeley Lab</a>.
				Here is my <a target="_newtab" href="/arvin_yung-resume.pdf"><i>résumé</i></a>.
			</p>
		
			<p class="main_body">
			I was born and raised in Rhode Island and have taken a liking to a myriad of interests, like building mechanical keyboards, baking, or trying to make a website without prior website-making knowledge! In my spare time, I will toil over crosswords, play video games, or watch a couple movies. During the semester, I should be in class, studying, or in the lab!
			</p>

			<p class="main_body">
			Anyways, thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you had a good read!
