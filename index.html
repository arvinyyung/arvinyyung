			Hello everyone! I'm a Masters student in <a target="_newtab" href="https://biotech.brown.edu/about/">Biotechnology</a> at Brown University. I have recentely joined the <a target="_newtab" href="https://sites.brown.edu/center-for-spine-tumor-chordoma-research/">Center for Spine Tumor & Chordoma Research Lab</a> where I am building on research relating to hydrogels as a drug delivery mechanism. 
				Before coming to Brown, I earned B.Scs. in Microbioloy and Psychology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. At UMass, I was an undergraduate reserach assistant in the <a target="_newtab" href="https://websites.umass.edu/wilmore/">Webeley Lab</a>.
				Here is my <a target="_newtab" href="/arvin_yung-resume.pdf"><i>résumé</i></a>.

			I was born and raised in Rhode Island and have taken a liking to a myriad of interests, like building mechanical keyboards or trying to make this website without any knowledge regarding websites! In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games or toiling over crossword puzzles. However, during the semester, you'll usually find me in class, studying, or in the lab.

			<p class="main_body">
			Anyway, thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you have a wonderful day!
